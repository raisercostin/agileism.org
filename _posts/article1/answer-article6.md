<p>Maybe we should first identify and define the problems of the current monetary system. </p>
<p>One idea would be to see where it all started: take the simplest possible monetary system and see what the problems were, how they were solved and retrospect if those solutions were correct or if a bigger problem was masked into said solution. A start in this direction would be this book: "Globalizing Capital: A History of the International Monetary System (Second Edition)" by Barry Eichengreen.</p>

<p>Upload sites are more and more cautious these days, so the pdf took a little digging. I am unaware if I am allowed to put a link to it here, but I will email it upon request.</p>
