<p>I think anyone should be allowed to own guns to be able to protect his rights as a self-defense form.
 - you should differentiate between own guns for attacks and own guns for defense
 - police cannot enforce defense in realtime
 - what happens if police/army goes against people will? this might be connected with the tragedy of the commons.</p>
<p>If you can listen romanian, watch <a href="http://inregistrari.antena3.ro/view-08_Mar-2012-In_gura_presei_cu_Mircea_Badea-5.html">a good argument here.</a>
See wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics">gun politics article</a></p>
