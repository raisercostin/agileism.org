<p>The problem has a lot to do with the defenders of animals' rights (NGOs who are funded with huge amounts of money to do nothing). They should be annihilated first. Then shoot the dogs. 
My anger regarding this kind of topics comes from a statement a dog defender has the chance to publicly share. Was happened a the funeral of a 4 years boy killed by dogs. And a lady (generally are ladies) said to the father who was there to bury his child: "I understand your pain. I felt exactly the same when my little dog died".</p>
