<p>There are two problems with stray dogs:
 1. they might be aggresive and when they are the cost is huge, going to deaths of people
 2. without control, the usual case, they tend to have a growing population.</p>
<p>That's why the number of dogs on the streets must be reduced to zero to solve both problems.
If you solve only the second problem, the growing population you still might have for a period of time the first problem, which might be sufficient for people to ask for drastic solutions.</p>
<p>So, what is the perfect solution?</p>
