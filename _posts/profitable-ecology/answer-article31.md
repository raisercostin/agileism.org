<p>This is a good example of cost savings by designing more energy-efficient systems:
<a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/12/lovins-protecting-the-environment-is-%E2%80%98a-highly-profitable-enterprise%E2%80%99/">http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/12/lovins-protecting-the-environment-is-%E2%80%98a-highly-profitable-enterprise%E2%80%99/</a></p>
<p>But I would like to find ideas which would indeed bring enough money to encourage people to actively take full-time jobs for protecting the natural resources and environments.</p>
<p>(Currently only a handful of people work within fields related to ecology and finding solutions for preserving the natural environment and resources, but if this would be very well-paid then a lot more people would work towards these goals)</p>
