<p>Usually poverty is not something that can be fought against directly, but it's just an effect (of the society and of people's own stupidity).</p>
<p>So I want to have here sugestions about fighting the causes that generate poverty.
(Which are usually one of these: corruption, abuses, inequality (economic and/or judicial), carelessness, and many times stupidity or lack of education regarding substances abuse.)</p>
<p>(I will come back to add a more precise list of causes, so we can address them one by one.)</p>
