<p>How you can have a good healthcare system?</p>
<p>In healthcare systems you have at least first 2 actors but most probably you will also have the 3rd:
 - the person
 - the healthcare provider
 - the healthcare payer</p>
<p>The final purpose of a healthcare system is the following
 - the person should be healthy all time
 - when ill the person should recover as soon as possible</p>
<p>Other objectives could be
 - the healthcare provider should provide quality service
 - the healthcare provider should provide the least expensive(cheapest) service
 - the healthcare payer should minimize the amounts payed
 - the total administrative costs should be minimized</p>
