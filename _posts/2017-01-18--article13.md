<p>At minimum I should have public access to the<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>list of all donors and amounts (eventually in realtime, and with some as annonymous)</li>
<li>List of all consumers and amounts (since is for charity, shouldn't have any hidden for competitive advantage)</li>
<li>Sum of received amounts, and consumed amounts</li>
<li>List of all acievements</li>
<li>List of persons that donate something except money</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a charity organization could attract money from me.
Till now i didn't see any charity ruled like this, but I donated money to: cultural project initiated by a friend, a philosopher that deserved money in exchange for a tone of podcasts that gave already for free to anyone, wikipedia, a small party that could have been transparent but in the end didn't.</p>
